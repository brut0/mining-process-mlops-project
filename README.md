## Problem definition: Silica concentrate in mining process
The main goal is to use minig data to predict how much silica is in the ore concentrate after flotation. Data comes from one of the most important parts of a mining process: [flotation plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froth_flotation). Concentrate of iron and silica in ore measures right before it is fed into the flotation plant, this data sampled every 1 hour. Other samples measured every 20 seconds, but there is problem with data stamps so this measures could sampled every hour too. Concentrate of iron after flotation couldn't be as feature and should be deleted because measures in lab after flotation.
Exploratory data analysis is in notebooks.
